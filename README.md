Box2D
=====

This Box2D branch was copied out of version 2.2.1 of Box2D.org, downloaded from https://code.google.com/p/box2d/downloads/detail?name=Box2D_v2.2.1.zip&can=2&q=

It contains mostly build adaptation for macosx, ios and android, with no C++ code change.

A convenient bash script is provided to build for OSX, IOS and Android: run $(BOX2D)/src/Build/fullbuild.sh
